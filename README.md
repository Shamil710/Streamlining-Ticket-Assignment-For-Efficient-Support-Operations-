Objective
- Minimize delays in issue resolution.
- Improve customer satisfaction.
- Optimize resource utilization in the support department.
- Automate repetitive routing tasks using **ServiceNow Flows** and **Access Control Rules**.
---
## Features
- Create users, groups, and roles within ServiceNow.
- Custom table: `Operations Related` for tracking support issues.
- Role-based access control using ACLs.
- Automated flow-based ticket assignment based on the issue type.
- Mobile module support.

## Issue Types & Group Assignments
| Issue Type | Assigned Group |
|----------------------------------|------------------|
| Regarding certificates | Certificates |
| Unable to login to platform | Platform |
| 404 error | Platform |
| Regarding user expired | Platform |
---
## Setup Instructions (ServiceNow)
### Create Users
1. Navigate to: `All > Users (under System Security)`
2. Click **New** and fill user details
3. Submit and repeat for additional users
### Create Groups
1. Go to: `All > Groups`
2. Add new groups such as `Platform`, `Certificates`
### Create Roles
1. Navigate to: `All > Roles`
2. Add roles like `Platform_role`, `Certificate_role`
### Create Table
- Label: `Operations Related`
- Enable: `Create module` and `Create mobile module`
- Add issue-related fields
### Add Choice Values to Issues
Choices include:
- Unable to login to platform
- 404 error
- Regarding certificates
- Regarding user expired
---
## Assign Users & Roles to Groups
- Add users like `Katherine Pierce` to the `Certificates` group and assign `Certificate_role`.
- Add users like `Manne Niranjan` to the `Platform` group and assign `Platform_role`.
---
## Configure Role Access to Table
- Use **Application Access** section of the `Operations Related` table.
- Require `Platform_role` and `Certificate_role` for read/write permissions.
---
## Create ACL (Access Control)
1. Navigate to: `All > Access Control (ACL)`
2. Add 4 ACLs for table and fields
3. Require `admin` role
---
## Create Flows (ServiceNow Flow Designer)
### Flow: Regarding Certificate
- Trigger: Record created/updated in `Operations Related`
- Condition: `issue == Regarding certificates`
- Action: Update `assigned_to_group = Certificates`
### Flow: Regarding Platform
- Trigger: Record created/updated in `Operations Related`
- Conditions:
`issue == Unable to login to platform`
`issue == 404 error`
`issue == Regarding user expired`
- Action: Update `assigned_to_group = Platform`
---
## Result
The system automatically assigns tickets based on issue type, enhancing service desk efficiency.
---
## Conclusion
This project successfully automates ticket routing in ServiceNow, improving resolution speed and team coordination. It provides a scalable solution that minimizes human error and manual interventions in support operations.
